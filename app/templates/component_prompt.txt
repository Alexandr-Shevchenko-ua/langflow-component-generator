You are generating a Langflow custom component as a single Python file.

Requirements:
- Target: Langflow "custom component" API (standard library only).
- Include: class metadata (display_name, description), type hints, docstring, input validation.
- Inputs/Outputs: implement exactly as specified by the user spec below.
- Compatibility: assume latest stable Langflow; avoid non-core imports.
- No side effects; pure computation.

User spec:
{{SPEC}}

Return format:
Return ONLY one single-line JSON object (no markdown, no backticks, no extra text).
Fields:
- "filename": string like "components/custom/{{SAFE_SLUG}}_component.py"
- "encoding": "base64"
- "language": "python"
- "code": base64 of the FULL file content (UTF-8)

Strictness:
- Any text outside the JSON is a fatal error.
- JSON must be valid.
- Keep replies under {{CHAR_LIMIT}} characters total.
Any text outside the single-line JSON object is a fatal error.
Do not use code fences or explanations.
Reliability rules:
- Do NOT use triple-quoted docstrings. Use a single # comment header instead.
- The file MUST be syntactically valid Python; imagine it will be parsed with ast.parse().
- Keep the file minimal; no long comments.
- Any text outside the single-line JSON is a fatal error.
